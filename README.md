# Symmetry Analysis of Differential Equations

This was my Bachelor's thesis project. 

Solving real-world differential equations is quite hard. The known techniques usually fail to give us an exact solution, so we resort to numerical techniques. However, the latter is prone to numerical instabilities. The symmetry method for solving differential equations is based on transforming a differential equation using its symmetries. Symmetries are basically coordinate transformations, which leave the differential equation invariant; the symmetries form a Lie group of transformations. 

For my thesis project, I used this method to solve a real-world differential equation: A coupled partial differential equation describing the spreading of the thin liquid film under the action of a surfactant. This is also called the "Marangoni effect". The proposed differential equation has been solved numerically; however, using the symmetry methods, I was able to find its semi-analytic solution [[1]](#1). This analysis was done in Mathematica.
